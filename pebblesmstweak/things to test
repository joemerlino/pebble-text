things to test

Does it work?
Does it request permission to access your contacts upon opening?
Does the initial install work smoothly?
Does the app use the proper country code (esp. for people outside the USA)?
If voice replies are supported for you (Verizon, AT&T, etc.), does voice reply still work? If so, does it save the sent SMS in your message history now?
Can you access recent contacts?
