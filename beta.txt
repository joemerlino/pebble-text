Hello,

As I said, 

Sorry for the delay in response, I've been working hard at fixing things before testing with more people. I created a jailbreak tweak and Pebble watchapp to allow users to send texts only using the watch. The jailbreak tweak hooks right into the Pebble app, so there's no standalone app on your phone. 

Once you've installed the jailbreak tweak and the app, you should be able to open the app on your Pebble and choose a recipient and message content and then send a message.

I'm asking you to test the functionality of the app and report any problems. You should tell me any problems or feedback that you have, but specifically I'm curious about the following questions:

Does it work reliably?
Is the interface intuitive or confusing?
If you've never granted Contacts permissions to the Pebble app on your phone, did it request these permissions when it opened?
Was loading a contact (in the watchapp) reliable?
Did it use the correct country code (especially if you're outside the US)? (I'm especially curious about this, I spent a lot of time yesterday trying to make this work reliably)
Does the message send reliably?
Is communication between phone and other watchapps interrupted?
If text replies were previously enabled for you (i.e. you're on AT&T or Verizon in the US, etc.), do texts send with the native text reply now show up in your Messages history?
Can you set canned texts in the Settings app under "TextSender for Pebble"?

In order to install, add http://sawyervaughan.com/repo to your Cydia sources. Then, install the package TextSender for Pebble from that repo. 

Next, install the watchapp using this link: https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/570534f2d7fa4e6ad300003c. 

Everything should work after that. If something crashes for you, you can send me crash logs at sawyervaughan@gmail.com. 

Thanks, 
Sawyer
